# Eclipse
DESC: Eclipse is an app that is designed to provide students with anxiety the tools and resources in order to cope and succeed in school. 
This app is currently a prototype, which we designed on Figma. However, many functions work including dark mode, scrolling, and navigating to different pages of the app. 
In order to use this app, you need to navigate to the Figma file and click "duplicate" which will allow you to demo the project. 

NOTE: We both know that no code was used in this project, which is because we both realized we didn't know enough Swift or Kotlin to turn this project into a real app, and we were too far to turn back at that time. We hope you enjoy this prototype with the comfort that we will both do our best to continue working on this project once our programming skills are better! (This is both of our first hackathons, if you don't count MLH Init for Sarah.)
